## Projects Overview

### Binary Search Trees
A program to implement and test a binary search tree.

### Cheaters!
A program to check for plagarisms in essays submitted by students using hashing.

### Code Camp
A series of simple functions to be used for the purpose of reviewing C fundamentals, practicing with one-dimensional arrays, experience writing test cases and using test scripts, practice with pre- and post-conditions, and use makefiles.

### Flood Fill (Recursion)
A program that, given a 2d array of letters that represent a painting, uses recursion to flood fill all areas of the array with a new color at the chosen point. In other words, if the user selects a yellow section of the painting to be filled with the color blue, the program will fill all yellow "bits" connected to the chosen section (not all yellow in the painting).

### Fun with Stacks
An implementation of a stack using both a linked list and an array. The linked list stack is used to solve the flood fill problem described iteratively, and the array stack is used as an equation checker, to validate proper structure of expressions.

### Game of Life
An introduction to 2D arrays through an implementation of the classic cellular automaton Conway's Game of Life.

### Go Fish!
An introduction to classes through an implementation of the classic game of Go Fish.

### Math Stuff
A program that uses recursion to implement simple math functions, such as checking if a number is prime, finding fibonacci sequence, and finding the facotrs of a number.

### UTPod
A program that implements classes and methods to simulate the storage portion of a small-scale iPod.
